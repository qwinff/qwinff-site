QWinFF is a GUI for [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org), a powerful command-line media converter. FFmpeg can read audio and video files in various formats and convert them into other formats. QWinFF provides an intuitive graphical interface and a rich set of presets to help you use ffmpeg easily without having to type a single command. Advanced users can also adjust conversion parameters like *bitrate* and *sample rate* in detail.

QWinFF also comes in handy when you need to make a video clip for a larger video. Starting from version 0.2.0, QWinFF features an interactive video-cutting interface that lets you watch the video and select the time range you want to convert. There is also an option that changes the speed of the video, making it possible to create slow-motion or fast-motion animations. And don't worry about the audio. Audio will also be rescaled without changing the pitch.

QWinFF is written in Qt4/C++ and currently runs on GNU/Linux and Windows. You can get latest stable version in [downloads](downloads.html) or check [changelogs](news) for more details.
