<h3>Translating Offline</h3>If you want to translate offline, you can download the latest translation package from the [Download page](downloads.html). If the translation package already contains your target language, just fill in missing translations in that file. If you're going to translate to a new language, please base your work on *qwinff-new-language.ts*. You may also want to download [Qt Linguist](http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/Qt+Linguist+Download?content=89360) to help you edit the translation file. If you insist on editing the file manually, please read **[Translator's Notes](p/translators.html)** first. Once you are done, please mail the translation file to lzh9102@gmail.com and we will upload it to Transifex.
