Downloads of QWinFF are hosted at SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/qwinff/files/.

Translation files included in the release are sometimes out-of-date because they are frequently updated. You can download the latest translation files ([20130911](http://sourceforge.net/projects/qwinff/files/translation/qwinff-ts-20130911.zip)) and copy all the ``*.qm`` files to the translation file directory (typically /usr/share/qwinff/translations on GNU/Linux and C:\Program Files (x86)\QWinFF\translations on Windows).

QWinFF depends on the following programs at runtime:

- ffmpeg (required)
- ffprobe (required)
- ffplay (optional, for previewing audio/video cutting)
- sox (optional, for adjusting audio speed)
